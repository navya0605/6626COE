2: Gender Disparities in Employment and Income

Gender-based pay gaps and underrepresentation in certain industries lead to significant disparities in income between men and women. 
Women may also face barriers like discrimination and limited access to career advancement opportunities.
schema:Gender, Income, Marital Status, Tax Filing Status, No. of Weeks Worked

Solution: Governments can introduce equal pay laws, gender quotas, and career advancement programs for women in underrepresented fields. Additionally, providing paid family leave and workplace anti-discrimination laws can support gender equality in the workplace.

How It Helps:
Equal pay laws ensure that men and women receive the same compensation for the same work, addressing the pay gap.
Paid family leave helps parents (especially women) stay employed while managing childcare responsibilities, leading to more equal participation in the workforce.

How It Helps:

Universal healthcare programs reduce the financial barriers to accessing necessary medical care.
Subsidized healthcare for low-income families ensures that medical care is affordable, improving overall public health outcomes.
